#  Evaluating the Impact of Model Merging: Enhancing NLP Task Performance by Integrating Fine-Tuned Small Models with BERT Base


In the rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the quest for building more efficient and effective models is continuous. Traditional approaches often involve fine-tuning large pre-trained models, like BERT Base, to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and named entity recognition. However, the computational costs and resource demands associated with fine-tuning these large models can be prohibitive, especially in real-world applications where efficiency is crucial.

Recent advancements have introduced smaller, more efficient models like TinyBERT, which are designed to retain much of the performance of their larger counterparts while significantly reducing computational requirements. These models have opened up new possibilities for creating lightweight NLP solutions. Yet, the question remains: can the strengths of these smaller models be effectively combined with the power of large pre-trained models to further enhance performance?

This project seeks to explore this possibility by evaluating whether merging a fine-tuned small model with a large pre-trained model can improve performance on specific NLP tasks, compared to the traditional approach of fine-tuning the large model alone. By leveraging the [GLUE benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/), which is widely recognized for benchmarking various NLP tasks, this study aims to provide insights into the potential benefits and trade-offs of model merging in practical applications.

The primary focus will be on determining whether a hybrid approach can offer a superior balance of accuracy, efficiency, and resource utilization, thereby contributing to the development of more versatile and scalable NLP systems.

## TODO
- [ ] document so far what I have done here(write it nicely)
- [ ] fine tune bert base on the data and save it --> save hyperparamters and wieghts
- [ ] fine tune tinybert and save it --> save hyperparamters and weights
- [ ] merge the finetuned tinybert with pretrained unfinetuned bert base --> save hyperparameters and wieghts(how the hell do i merge them?)
- [ ] comprare the two models (comparison in terms of metrics and some hardware constraints )
- [ ] remember to create the environment .txt
